# Array_filesum
The purpose of this assignment is to enhance the processing  * performed by the FileSum program. This program will read values   * from the input file into an array prior to processing these values.   * The input file contains exactly five double values, enough to fill   * the array. There is no reason to check for an end of file condition.   * The values read from the file are to be placed into the array in the   * order in which they were read. The first value read from the first will  * be stored in the first element of the array, and so on.   * After the array has elements, the program can close the input file and   * no more processing will be done. The second part of this program is to   * calculate and print the lowest value, highest value, sum of the values,   * and the average of the values stored in the array. After processing this,  * the program will report the array position that contains this value. The program   * should be able to accept any input file specified by the user of the program.
