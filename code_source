/*
 * The purpose of this assignment is to enhance the processing
 * performed by the FileSum program. This program will read values 
 * from the input file into an array prior to processing these values. 
 * The input file contains exactly five double values, enough to fill 
 * the array. There is no reason to check for an end of file condition. 
 * The values read from the file are to be placed into the array in the 
 * order in which they were read. The first value read from the first will
 * be stored in the first element of the array, and so on. 
 * After the array has elements, the program can close the input file and 
 * no more processing will be done. The second part of this program is to 
 * calculate and print the lowest value, highest value, sum of the values, 
 * and the average of the values stored in the array. After processing this,
 * the program will report the array position that contains this value. The program 
 * should be able to accept any input file specified by the user of the program.
